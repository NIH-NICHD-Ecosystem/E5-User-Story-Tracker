# E5: NICHD User Story Tracker Template Effort

### The NICHD Office of Data Science and Sharing developed a User Story Tracker Template to systematically capture researcher needs, practices, and barriers in data science and data sharing. This structured, reusable framework enables ODSS—and other organizations—to prioritize resources, distinguish real from perceived challenges, and deliver impactful, policy-aligned solutions.

# Effort Overview 

<p> The NICHD Office of Data Science and Sharing (ODSS) seeks to systematically understand the data science and data sharing needs of NICHD staff and researchers. Currently, there is no mechanism for capturing these needs in a structured way, which makes it difficult to prioritize and scope work effectively. As a result, resources and solutions may be misaligned with the most urgent pain points.

The ultimate goal of this effort is to create a User Story Tracker Template that enables ODSS to develop, prioritize, and deliver resources that directly support NICHD researchers in sharing and using scientific data. This process goes beyond documenting expressed needs—it also distinguishes between real and perceived barriers to achieving data science and data sharing goals. By clarifying underlying needs and creating visibility into pain points, the User Story Tracker Template ensures that solutions are not just quick fixes, but lasting and impactful.

ODSS also lacks visibility into the day-to-day practices of researchers, which prevents alignment between current practices and the long-term vision of the NICHD Data Ecosystem, as well as broader NIH, HHS, and federal policies. The User Story Tracker Template addresses this gap by providing a structured, repeatable process to capture researcher practices, needs, and barriers. With this framework, ODSS can focus limited resources on the most significant issues, develop strategies to promote best practices, and build ecosystem solutions that enable more effective, efficient, and policy-aligned data sharing.

Importantly, this effort is designed not only for NICHD, but also as a reusable template for other organizations seeking to better understand their own data science and data sharing challenges. By adopting and adapting the User Story Tracker Template, other offices and research organizations can establish their own structured processes to document needs, distinguish real barriers from perceived ones, and ensure that resources are aligned with the most critical priorities. </p>

## Documentation Files
We are pleased to share the NICHD User Story Tracker Template, a structured tool designed to help organizations systematically capture researcher and staff needs in data science and data sharing. This template provides a clear, repeatable framework for documenting user goals, identifying real versus perceived barriers, and prioritizing solutions that align with organizational strategy and federal policy.

We encourage other organizations to adopt and adapt this template to fit their own context. By using the Story Tracker Template, teams can ensure they are focusing limited resources on the most pressing challenges, promoting best practices, and developing solutions that deliver lasting impact across the research ecosystem.
